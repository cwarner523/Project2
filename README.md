# Recipe App

## Projects Name and Description

The name of my app is Delicio. It is an app that allows users to look through different recipes that are categorized by their "health label" and can be saved to the users profile page. They can then delete them off of their saved recipes page. The user has a profile page where they are able to add recipes, and view their saved recipes page. The user can also edit the recipe.

## The technologies Used

For this project I created my own database with 3 different tables a user table, a recipe table, and users recipe table. This allowed me make the joint table of users recipe and take the users id and the recipes id and join them in order for the saved recipe to be shown on the users profile page.

## Any things You Plan To Add

I plan to add an npm package to the user profile that parses the time in that specifc time zone.
